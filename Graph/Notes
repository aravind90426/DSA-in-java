Graph
    -> veetex / Nodes
    -> Edges
  Tyepes of Graph
      -> Undirected Graph    contains Undirected Edges
      -> Directed Graph      contains Undirected Edges   also have bidirectional Edges

  Cycles
      start and end with a same Node  even it can be in directed and undireted graph

      Direct Cyclic Graph
      Directed Acyclic Graph

  Path
    Contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reachable

    Degrees in a graph

    the no of edges from inside and outside of the node

      ->  Undirected graph -  property

         Total degree = 2 * E a graph

      -> Directed Graph

           -> Indegree
           -> outDegree


   Edge Weight

     weights  - Default 1


Input of the graph will given  Edges and Vertex

 it can be  like


  1 2     not give 2 1 either one
  1 3
  2 4
  3 4
  2 5
  4 5



Connected graph

 if 10 vetex will be given. 5 only marked to another .  balanc are seprated . then we use visited array  for travesal all of them
