Greedy method

Feasible solution :   no of solutions satisfies the given constraint
Optimal Solution :  minimum cost in the feasible solutioon.
                     there is only one optimal solution in th e feasible solution

optimization prblm: if the prob;lem required either minimum result or maximum result then it is called optimaization


greeedy method is used for solving optimization problenm.   and also
 -> DP and
    -> Brach and Bound.


    greedy method sholuld solve stages.
