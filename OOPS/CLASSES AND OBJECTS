OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE


CLASS
    class is a named group of properties and function.

  ->  class is an template of object

  ->  simply known as

     class is a logical construct


OBJECT

  -> object is an instead of class
(its follow the class template and creates an object)

  -> simply known as physical entity  // occupies space in memory.


->  objects are stored in heap memory.
->   reference variable are stored in stack memory.( object ku vekka pora name)

eg

public class Student{
    int rno;
    String name;
    float marks;
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // creating object for that class

        Student s1=new Student();

        // new :: dynamically allocate memory and returns a reference variable to it


                                    // default value
        System.out.println(s1.rno);   //0
        System.out.println(s1.name);  // null
        System.out.println(s1.marks); // 0.0
        //  boolean                   // false
    }

}




	student s1      =      new student():
	__________              _____________

       compile time             | run time
				|
				| memory will be allocate at the runtime


assignig values
----------------

  Student s1=new Student();

        s1.name="arun";
        s1.rno=6;
        s1.marks=90.0f;

        System.out.println(s1.rno);          // arun
        System.out.println(s1.name);        // 6
        System.out.println(s1.marks);       //90.0





you can also create multiple objects
	Student s1=new Student();
	Student s2=new Student();
	Student s3=new Student();
	Student s4=new Student();


s1,s2.... are stored in stack memory
they are called reference variable

name,rno,marks  are stored in heap memory
they are called object variables
